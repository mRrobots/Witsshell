In this assignment, you will implement a command line interpreter (CLI) or, as it is more commonly known,
a shell. The shell should operate in this basic way: when you type in a command (in response to its prompt),
the shell creates a child process that executes the command you entered and then prompts for more user input
when it has finished.
The shells you implement will be similar to, but simpler than, the one you run every day in Unix. If you
don’t know what shell you are running, it’s probably bash. One thing you should do on your own time is learn
more about your shell, by reading the man pages or other online materials
